# Cross Site Scripting Tutorial

## What is Cross Site Scripting?
Cross Site Scripting (XSS) attacks are code injection, in which malicious scripts are injected in a website. The scripts can access cookies, session tokens, make the users complete certain actions with the browser, or change/rewrite the content of the HTML page.
XSS attacks are the most common website attacks, followed by SQL injection and file upload. Therefore, this tutorial will help you learn about types of XSS attacks and how to prevent them.

1. **Stored XSS Attacks** 
2. **Reflected XSS Attacks**
